# Graph Module

The [graph](cci:2://file:///f:/dev/firebase/extensions/graph/graph.ts:76:4-80:5) module provides a framework for defining and executing task graphs in TypeScript. This allows developers to create complex workflows where tasks can execute based on the output of previous tasks.

## Key Components

- **Symbols**:
  - `UNDEFINED`, `ELSE`, and `ERROR` are unique symbols representing special states within the graph.

- **Types and Interfaces**:
  - **Task**: Represents a unit of work that can be executed.
  - **Edge**: Represents a connection between tasks in the graph.
  - **Graph**: Represents the entire task graph, including its name and entry point.

- **Execution Logic**:
  - The [exec](cci:1://file:///f:/dev/firebase/extensions/graph/graph.ts:98:4-118:5) function manages the execution of tasks based on their defined relationships.

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example demonstrating how to use the [graph](cci:2://file:///f:/dev/firebase/extensions/graph/graph.ts:76:4-80:5) module:

```typescript
import graph from './graph';

// Define your tasks
const task1: graph.Task<any, any, any> = {
    name: 'Task 1',
    execute: async (args: any[]) => {
        console.log('Executing Task 1');
        return 'Result from Task 1';
    },
};

const task2: graph.Task<any, any, any> = {
    name: 'Task 2',
    execute: async (args: any[]) => {
        console.log('Executing Task 2');
        return 'Result from Task 2';
    },
    edges: new Map([
        ['Result from Task 1', { name: 'Edge from Task 1 to Task 2', target: 'Task 2' }],
    ]),
});

// Define the graph
const myGraph: graph.graph<any, any> = {
    name: 'My Task Graph',
    entry: 'Task 1',
    taskes: {
        'Task 1': task1,
        'Task 2': task2,
    },
};

// Execute the graph
async function runGraph() {
    const result = await graph.exec(myGraph, this, [], 'Task 1');
    console.log('Final Result:', result);
}

runGraph();
